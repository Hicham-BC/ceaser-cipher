Caesar Cipher

Description:
This is a Python program that implements the Caesar Cipher, a simple encryption technique. It allows you to encode or decode messages by shifting the letters in the alphabet.

Usage:
Run the program.
Choose whether you want to 'encode' or 'decode' a message.
Enter the message you want to process.
Enter the shift number, which determines how much each letter should be shifted.
The program will display the encoded or decoded message.

Note:
The program only works with lowercase letters. Any non-alphabet characters in the input message will remain unchanged.
